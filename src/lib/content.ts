The plot is straightforward, but it’s engaging enough to keep you entertained. The pacing is on point, and there’s a nice balance of humor and action. It shows promise for a future watch and has a strong foundation for further development if it were to expand on the story."

The storyline may not be anything revolutionary, but the characters and pacing hold up well enough for repeat viewings. It’s the kind of film that you can put on for a fun, laid-back watch and still enjoy the second or third time around."
